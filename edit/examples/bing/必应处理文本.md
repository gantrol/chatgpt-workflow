Q: powershell ls only names

Bing: Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with PowerShell commands.😊

According to [1](https://shellgeek.com/powershell-ls-command/), the ls command in PowerShell can be used to get the list of files and directories and their information. You can use aliases like Get-ChildItem, dir, or GCI for ls.

[If you want to list only the names of files and not folders, you can use a filter like -File with ls or Get-ChildItem](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/b6f0cc1c-afba-465d-909c-bb2db2b9ed81/using-getchilditem-to-list-only-file-and-not-folder-names) [2](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/b6f0cc1c-afba-465d-909c-bb2db2b9ed81/using-getchilditem-to-list-only-file-and-not-folder-names). For example:

`ls -File | Select-Object Name`

This will list only the names of files in the current directory.

[If you want to list only the names of directories and not files, you can use a filter like -Directory with ls or Get-ChildItem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33787200/get-directories-names-only) [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33787200/get-directories-names-only). For example:

`ls -Directory | Select-Object Name`

This will list only the names of directories in the current directory.

I hope this helps. Do you have any other questions about PowerShell commands?
